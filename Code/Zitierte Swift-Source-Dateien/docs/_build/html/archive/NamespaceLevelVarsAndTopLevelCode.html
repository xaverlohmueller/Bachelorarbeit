<h1>Mutable Namespace-Scope Variable Declarations<a class="headerlink" href="#mutable-namespace-scope-variable-declarations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>A namespace-scope variable (i.e. a variable not inside a function) is allowed to
have an initializer, and that initializer is allowed to have side effects.
Thus, we have to decide how and when the initializer runs.</p>
<p>WLOG, lets assume that all namespace-scope variables are mutable (and thus that
immutable variables are just an optimization of the common case).  Given that
they can have mutable state, they cannot be &#8220;global&#8221; (in the C sense) because
then they would be visible across multiple actors.  Instead, the only logical
semantic is for them to be actor-local data (&#8220;thread local&#8221; in the C sense) of
some sort.</p>
<p>Given that there can be many of these variables in an address space, and very
few of them may be dynamically used by any particular actor, it doesn&#8217;t make
sense to allocate space for all of the variables and run all of the initializers
for the variables at actor-startup-time.  Instead, swift should handle these as
&#8220;actor associated data&#8221; (stored in a hashtable that the actor has a pointer to)
and should be lazily initialized (in the absence of &#8216;top level code&#8217;, see
below).</p>
<p>This means that if you write code like this (optionally we could require an
attribute to make it clear that the value is actor local):</p>
<div class="highlight-swift"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>func foo(_ a : int) -&gt; int { print(a) return 0 }

var x = foo(1)
var y = foo(2)
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>That the print statements will execute the first time that x or y is used by any
particular actor.</p>
<div class="section" id="top-level-code">
<h2>Top Level Code<a class="headerlink" href="#top-level-code" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>One goal of swift is to provide a very &#8220;progressive disclosure&#8221; model of writing
code and learning how to write code.  Therefore, it is desirable that someone be
able to start out with:</p>
<div class="highlight-swift"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;hello world</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s">&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>as their first application.  This requires that we support &#8220;top level code&#8221;,
which is code outside any function or other declaration.  The counter-example of
this is java, which requires someone to look at &#8220;class foo / public static void
main String[]....&#8221; all of which is non-essential to the problem of writing a
simple app.</p>
<p>Top level code is useful for a number of other things: many scripts written by
unix hackers (in perl, bourne shell, ruby, etc) are really just simple command
line apps that may have a few helper functions and some code that runs.  While
not essential, it is a great secondary goal to make these sorts of simple apps
easy to write in Swift as well.</p>
<p>Top-Level code and lazily evaluated variable initializers don&#8217;t mix well, nor
does top level code and multiple actors.  As such, the logical semantics are:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Source files are partitioned into two cases: &#8220;has TLC&#8221; and &#8220;has no TLC&#8221;.</li>
<li>All variables defined in &#8220;has no TLC&#8221; files are allocated and initialized
lazily.</li>
<li>Source files that have TLC are each initialized in a deterministic order: The
dependence graph of domains is respected (lower level domains are initialized
before dependent ones), and the source files within a domain are initialized
in some deterministic order (perhaps according to their filename or
something, TBD).</li>
<li>Within a source file with TLC, the TLC is run top down in deterministic order
whenever the file&#8217;s initializer is run.  This initializer executes in the
context of the &#8220;first&#8221; actor, which is created on behalf of the program by
the runtime library.</li>
<li>If/when some other actor refers to a variable in a file with TLC, it is
allocated and initialized lazily just like globals in &#8220;has no TLC&#8221; files.</li>
</ol>

<div class="section" id="on-not-having-headers">
<h2>On &#8220;Not Having Headers&#8221;<a class="headerlink" href="#on-not-having-headers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>One intentional design decision in swift is to not have header files, even for
public API.  This is a design point like Java, but unlike C or Objective-C.
Having header files for public API is nice for a couple of reasons:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>You <em>force</em> people to think about what they are making public, and the act of
having to put it into a header makes them think about its fragility and
duration over time.</li>
<li>Headers are a very convenient place to get an overview of what an API is and
does.  In Java you get all the implementation details of a class mixed in
with its public API, which makes it very difficult to understand &#8220;at a
glance&#8221; what a class does.</li>
<li>Headers are very useful documentation for Objective-C because we ship the
headers but not the implementation of system classes.  This allows &#8220;jump to
definition&#8221; to go to the declaration of an API in the header, which is
conveniently co-located with headerdoc.</li>
</ol>
<p>On the other hand, headers have a number of disadvantages including:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>It is plain code duplication, with all the negative effects of it.  It slows
down development, can get out of synch, makes changing API more difficult,
etc.</li>
<li>If the prototype and implementation get out of synch, it is caught by the
compiler, but this isn&#8217;t true for API comments.</li>
<li>Swift natively won&#8217;t &#8220;need&#8221; headers, so we&#8217;d have to specifically add this
capability, making the language more complicated.</li>
<li>The implementation of a framework may not be in swift.  If you&#8217;re talking to
a C or C++ framework, showing a C or C++ header when &#8220;jumping to definition&#8221;
is not particularly helpful.  We&#8217;d prefer to show you the synthesized API
that swift code should be using.</li>
<li>In Swift, the implementation of some datatype can be split across different
files.  Forcing all their declarations to be next to each other lexically is
an arbitrary restriction.</li>
</ol>
<p>To address the disadvantages of not having headers, we think that we should:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Standardize on a syntax for doc comments, and bake it into the language.
Mistakes using it should be diagnosed by the compiler.  It should be a
warning for public API to not have comments.</li>
<li>There needs to be an API that dumps out the public interface for a compiled
module/domain in swift syntax, slicing on a declaration.  When used on a
type, for example, this would show the type definition and the declaration of
all of the methods on it.</li>
<li>The API dumper should always dump in swift syntax, even when run on a Clang
C/C++/ObjC module.  It should make it very clear what the API maps to in
swift syntax, so it is obvious how to use it.</li>
<li>Not having headers forces us to have really great tools support/integration.</li>
</ol>
